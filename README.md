# labuino
Graphical arduino lab.

It's my perception that many Arduino projects are fairly simple. A few
input devices, a few output devices and some code to hold it all
togehter.

It's also my perception that the code part is the tricky bit for many
newcomers.

My intention with labuino is to explore a graphical representation of
devices and events that drives such arduino projects and see if it may
in fact be a useful way of expressing simple projects.

There is a second motivating force behind this. And that is teaching
kids to code. I feel that there is a gap between scratch that is used
successfully to introduce kids to programing. But the step towards
programing in other environments is large. I hope to incorporate
scratch-like programing into labuino to give a real world, tangible
use for someone already versed in scratch.

Finally, a byproduct of a labuino project should be a readable working
sketch so that the "real" code behind it can be studied.
